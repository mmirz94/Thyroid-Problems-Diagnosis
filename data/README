The data set was downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thyroid+Disease
Only "allhyper.data", "allhyper.names", "allrep.data", and "allrep.names" were used. 
I created CSV files from them to be able to open and read them using Pandas library.
You can download the CSV files here. :)
